Hello, TheInternetAuthor here. 🦀
I'm an indie developer dabbling in UX design and game dev, with most of my stat points in HTML and JS. I'm trying to branch out to C++/C# at the moment,
and hope to do so within the year. 👨‍💻
Currently working on a little app to brush up on my UX design skills, and make some JS magic. ✨
If you want to collaborate, simply send me an email at theinternetauthor@gmail.com! 📨
